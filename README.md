OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project : Student Database Management
Overview : I created a database to manage student records, including
personal details, courses, and grades. This project helps us to
practice creating and managing relational databases. I also designed
tables for students, courses, and enrollments. I have also written SQL
queries to manage student records. And implemented joins to
combine data from multiple tables.
